Forecasting Energy Consumption Using Smart Meter Data
SDG Focus: SDG 7 – Affordable and Clean Energy

This project supports Sustainable Development Goal 7, which aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all. By accurately forecasting electricity demand, the project contributes to optimizing energy distribution, minimizing blackouts, and enabling better integration of renewable energy into national grids.

Goal

To predict short-term and long-term electricity demand using historical smart meter data. These forecasts help balance energy supply, reduce inefficiencies, and guide sustainable grid management strategies.

AI/ML Approach

Techniques Employed:

Linear Regression – A baseline statistical model that learns the linear relationship between input features (e.g., time, temperature, usage patterns) and energy consumption.

Random Forest Regressor – An ensemble of decision trees that captures complex, nonlinear relationships between variables to improve prediction accuracy.

Random Forest Classifier – Converts continuous consumption values into categorical bins (e.g., low, medium, high usage) to predict energy levels for classification tasks.

LSTM Neural Network (Long Short-Term Memory) – A deep learning model specialized for sequential data. It learns temporal dependencies across time steps, making it powerful for energy forecasting over time.

Cross-validation and Scaling – StandardScaler was applied to normalize features, and 5-fold cross-validation validated model consistency and reduced overfitting risk.

Input Data:
Historical energy usage readings, time of day, temperature, and user behavior patterns.

Output:
Predicted hourly and daily electricity consumption values.

Results

The models produced strong regression metrics (low RMSE, high R²) on both test and holdout sets.

Linear Regression provided a clear baseline with interpretable relationships.

Random Forest Regressor improved accuracy through nonlinear feature interactions.

LSTM delivered the best temporal forecasting performance, successfully capturing long-term consumption trends.

These predictions enable proactive load balancing, reduced operational costs, and improved renewable integration by aligning generation with expected demand.

Ethical and Practical Considerations

Data Privacy: Smart meter data must be anonymized to prevent user identity exposure.

Bias and Fairness: Models should ensure fair energy distribution across demographics and prevent geographic or socioeconomic bias.

Transparency: Maintaining explainable models ensures stakeholder trust in automated grid decisions.

Sustainability: Accurate forecasting minimizes energy waste and enhances renewable energy utilization, contributing directly to SDG 7 targets.

Conclusion

The machine learning pipeline—combining Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM models—successfully achieves the project goal of forecasting energy consumption. The resulting predictions support sustainable energy management, cost reduction, and improved reliability of power systems, aligning strongly with the global pursuit of Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG 7).
